# DiFund

DiFund is an Android application on a mission to transform disaster relief by harnessing the power of blockchain technology. This innovative approach tackles the long-standing issue of opacity in traditional disaster fund management systems. DiFund utilizes a secure, public ledger powered by blockchain to record every single transaction involving disaster funds. It creates a transparent and tamper-proof record accessible to anyone with an internet connection. By enabling users to verify how funds are utilized, DiFund fosters trust and accountability within the entire disaster relief ecosystem.
